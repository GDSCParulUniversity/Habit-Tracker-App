We invite you to join the GDSC PU team, which is made up of volunteers and sponsored folk alike!
There are many ways to contribute, including writing code, filing issues on GitHub, helping people
on our mailing lists, our chat channels, or on Stack Overflow, helping to triage, reproduce, or
fix bugs that people have filed, adding to our documentation,
doing outreach about Flutter, or helping out in any other way.

We grant commit access (which includes full rights to the issue
database, such as being able to edit labels) to people who have gained
our trust and demonstrated a commitment to Flutter.

We communicate primarily over GitHub and [Discord](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Chat).

Before you get started, we encourage you to read these documents which describe some of our community norms:

1. [Our code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which stipulates explicitly
   that everyone must be gracious, respectful, and professional. This
   also documents our conflict resolution policy and encourages people
   to ask questions.

2. [Values](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Values),
   which talks about what we care most about.
